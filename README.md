Testing effectiveness of EEG data augmentation with GANs for BCI classifiers.

This repository contains the most important files used during my research project on the effectiveness of EEG data augmentation with GANs for BCI classifiers.
In the project, different GAN models were tested and used to create artificial P300-speller EEG data. This artificial data was then augmented in to the original datasets and the performance of P300 Classifier models were compared between the original dataset Classifier version and with the version that used the augmented dataset.
